# DrillWriter
I will keep the basic code I have on here, open source for anyone to use.

I will add cooler stuff like saving, making the drill cards, etc.
However, I will move this to a private repository hosted by Georgia Tech, at github.gatech.edu/jherndon8

# Compile / Run
~~~
$ javac  *.java
$ java DrillWriter
~~~
